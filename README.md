# Touch&Tell App
Our solution is an android application for the company Touch&Tell. The application will be a new way for companies to collect information from their employees, by letting the employees, through their phones, individually answer questions in a simple way. The questions are decided by the company, which might focus on how satisfied the employee is with their workspace. The new application will complement the family of platforms the brand is already established on, while also providing new functionality allowing individuals to record their well-being and analyze as well as reflect over it in a chosen period of time. A goal of the application is to increase the answer rate from employees on surveys, by making it more simple to answer.

_This project is created by the group Toto. It is apart of the course Agile software project management - DAT257 for year 2022. A course at Chalmers University of Technology._
